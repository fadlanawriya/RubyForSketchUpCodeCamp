a=10
b=3

c=a+b
  # this is easy
  # this operator assigns values from right side operand and assign the result to the left operand
  # c=a+b will assign the value of a+b into c

puts c # this will print the value of c in your ruby console

c=c+b
puts c

c+=b
  # this operator adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operands
  # c+=a is equivalent to c=c+a

puts c

# and soon
puts "this is the end of basic03"
